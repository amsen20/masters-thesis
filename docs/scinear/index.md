# Scinear: A linear type plugin for Scala

This chapter explains `Scinear`. It begins with the definition of a linear type and the rules that are enforced for linear types (e.g., they should not have methods). Then, the chapter continues explaining how linear types are integrated into Scala type polymorphism and capturing types. In the end, the implementation details of the plugin are explored.
