# Evaluation

To evaluate `imem` properly, two properties of the library should be checked:
- _Expressiveness_: To showcase that `imem` can implement common data structures and is easy to use, a stack backed by a safe linked list is implemented first in pure Scala and then using `imem`. Then, the differences are discussed.
	- REAL LIBRARY (OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE)
- CORRECTNESS: INFORMAL PROOF OF CORRECTNESS, ANY LIMITATION OF CORRECTNESS (SOUNDNESS HOLES). PROOF USING MOTIVATION OF DESIGN DECISONS AND TEST CASES.
